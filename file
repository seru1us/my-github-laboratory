So I just wanted to play around with some Git fundamentals.

Like rebasing, branching, merging, etc

so essentially I'll be making a ton of changes to this file

in different versions.

So let's start with some data below:


Line 12 - A
Line 13 - B
Line 14 - C
Line 15 - D
Line 16 - E
Line 17 - F
Line 18 - G
Line 19 - H
Line 20 - I
Line 21 - J
